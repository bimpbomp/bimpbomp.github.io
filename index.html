                Welcome to my little piece of the internet. 
                I've recently started to dabble in TypeScript, and that's what will be linked to here.

                This project is an attempt by me to create a 2D simulation of the sea (sortof).
                The plan is:
                <ul>
                    <li>The player is in a boat</li>
                    <li>There are islands that the player cannot sail onto (obviously)</li>
                    <li>Different water depths and currents will force the player to think about where to move</li>
                    <li>Fish will be swimming around</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
